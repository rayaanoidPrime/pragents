  <h3>💬 Data Agents, Really!</h3>
  <p>Data Agent is an agentic AI harnessing GenAI to automate and streamline data engineering workflows.  
  By delivering complete, well-prepared data requests, it saves time and reduces bottlenecks across teams.</p>  
</div>

## ✨ Features

- 🤖 **Multi-agent collaboration** - Engage with specialized data engineering agents
- 🔄 **Multiple backend support** - Connect to OpenAI, Claude, Gemini or Ollama for private deployments
- 🔗 **n8n integration** - Use n8n workflows for agent orchestration
- 🎯 **Strategy-based approach** - Different strategies for various data engineering tasks
- 🌙 **Modern dark UI** - Beautiful, responsive interface inspired by LobeChat
- 🚀 **Docker ready** - Easy deployment with Docker Compose

## 🚀 Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/HotTechStack/dataagents.git
cd dataagents

# Start the application
docker-compose up -d
```

### 🔧 Setup Steps

1. Once the containers are running, go to n8n at http://localhost:5678
2. Upload the workflow from the `agents/n8n/conversations` directory
3. Configure your API keys:
   - In Docker Compose: update OpenAI/Claude/Gemini key
   - In n8n workflow: click on OpenAI/Claude/Gemini model block and add your key
   - See [n8n documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/openai/#using-api-key) for more details

4. Visit http://localhost:3000 and start interacting with your agents!

## 🧩 Running Locally

If you prefer running the application without Docker:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/HotTechStack/dataagents.git
cd dataagents

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the development server
pnpm run dev
```

You can still use your own hosted n8n instance or the Docker integrated version while running the frontend locally.
